# Content-based-Movie-Recommendation-system
I am excited to introduce you to my newly developed Movie Recommendation System. This innovative system is designed to help movie enthusiasts discover the best and most popular movies based on their preferred tags and interests.

How it Works:
Tag-Based Recommendation: Our system uses a movies information, each tagged with various descriptors such as genre, director, actors, plot elements, and more. Users can view movies that are similar to the one they provide.
Popularity Scoring: The system not only considers most preferable tags but also factors in a movie's popularity.
